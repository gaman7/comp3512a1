<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>Welcome to our website! This project is a PHP-based data-generated web application that provides information about hit songs from 2016 to 2019.</p>

<p>We are a team of developers who created this website as part of our assignment. Our goal is to provide users with the ability to browse and filter songs, examine single songs, and add songs to a favorite list.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to <a href="contact_us.php">contact us</a>.</p>
